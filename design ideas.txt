twitter-like tags, but with bolded default tags

hard-coded categories?????????????????????????????????????????
	make user choose category
	
"special" interests (meta interests)
	e.g. help/tutoring, job, research, project, textbooks, 
	just different in that they're "default" (they get bolded if used)
	and they're associated with category
	
if a tag gets in the 95th percentile of posts, it becomes a default tag?
